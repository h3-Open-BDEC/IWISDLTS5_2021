<h2>Goal of the Workshop</h2>
<p>
Towards the end of Moore's law, we need to develop new algorithms and applications. We are developing h3-Open-BDEC, which is innovative software for sustainable promotion of scientific discovery by supercomputers in the Exascale Era by combining (Simulation + Data + Learning (S+D+L)), where ideas of data science and machine learning are introduced to computational science. Integration of (S+D+L) is also important for realization of Society 5.0, which is a “Super Smart and Human-centered Society” by digital innovation, such as IoT, Big Data, AI etc., and by integration of cyber-space (digital/virtual space) and physical-space (real space). The h3-Open-BDEC project is funded by Japanese Government via JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research（S）(Leading PI: Kengo Nakajima, the University of Tokyo, 19H05662) since 2019. In this workshop, we would like to report our progress of research and development in recent 2 years. While there are talks by Co-PI’s and members of the project, we have 6 excellent invited talks from Japan, Taiwan, USA and Germany. All members of the project are happy to welcome all participants, and would like to discuss on various aspects of integration of (S+D+L). Please enjoy this two-day online event.
