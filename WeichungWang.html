  <h2>Medical Data Analytics and Beyond</h2>
  <h3><u>Weichung Wang</u> (National Taiwan University, Taiwan)   <font color="red">Invited Talk</font></h3>
<p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a promising new era of smart and precision medicine. Interdisciplinary collaborations play a critical role in the research, education, and productization of medical AI. We will illustrate how the "Medical Data Analytics Framework" may achieve the end-to-end R&D life-cycle. The framework includes project design, multimodality data, intelligent analytics, medical workflows, regulation and ethics, and solution landing. We will also demonstrate examples of how medical AI algorithms and tools can reduce physicians' loading and improve patient outcomes.
