  <h2>Low/Adaptive Precision Computation in Preconditioned Iterative Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Problems</h2>
<h3><u>Masatoshi Kawai</u> (Information Technology Center, The University of Tokyo)</h3>
<p>The usefulness of low/adaptive precision is being discussed mainly in deep learning to reduce computational time and power consumption. In order to use low/adaptive precision in computer simulations, it is also necessary to discuss the impact of decreased computation accuracy. This talk discusses the use of low/adaptive precision on an ICCG iterative method by evaluating an impact on a convergence rate and reducing computational time.</p>
