  <h2>Integration of 3D Earthquake Simulation & Real-Time Data Assimilation using h3-Open-BDEC</h2>
<h3><u>Kengo Nakajima</u> (Information Technology Center, The University of Tokyo)</h3>
<p>Japan is a country with many natural disasters. In particular, the damage caused by the earthquake is enormous. Over the last 20 years, large earthquakes have occurred in Kobe, Niigata, Tohoku, Kumamoto, etc. Although it is extremely difficult to predict the occurrence of an earthquake, research is currently being actively conducted to minimize damage after an earthquake occurs.</p><p>We have applied the prototype of h3-Open-BDEC to Seism3D/OpenSWPC-DAF (Data-Assimilation-Based Forecast), which was developed by ERI/U.Tokyo for integration of simulation and data assimilation. In this talk, we will describe the demonstration of real-time data assimilation of the developed code on the Oakbridge-CX system at the University of Tokyo, using measured data through JDXnet (Japan Data eXchange network) with 2,000+ high-sensitivity/broadband seismic observation stations in Japan.</p>
